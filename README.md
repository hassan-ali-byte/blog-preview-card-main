## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5 markup** (`<article>`, `<time>`, etc.)
- **CSS custom properties** for theme colors and font
- **Grid** for centering
- **Flexbox** for layout
- **Clamp()** for responsive width without media queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project gave me a chance to strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques. Some key takeaways:

- Using proper semantic tags: `h1`/`h2` for section titles, `<p>` and `<span>` for the author name, and `<time>` for the publish date.
- I already knew how to use `clamp()` for responsive fonts, but in this project I applied it for component widths. It worked perfectly and reduced the need for media queries.
